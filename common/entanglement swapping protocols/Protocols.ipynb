Now, we might fail to connect 1 and n if the link between 1 and (n-1) expires by the time (n-1) and n are connected and (n-1) gets some classically communicated signal to do the entanglement swapping. \n",

This way, when the node at (n-1) gets the signal to swap, it will necessarily have a shared pair with node 1. We can do the same for (n-1) and n as well.\n",

So, we start creating the first pair at time t=0 and the (w+1)th pair at time wt. The first pair expires at time (e+c) and the (w+1)th pair is created at time wt+c.
